"Data analysis is not just about presenting data, but to build a story and create a meaningful narrative from the raw data. At the end of the day, that's what analytics is all about - not about writing code, not about crunching numbers, not about memorizing formula syntax - it's about deriving meaning and context from the data and, more importantly, using it to make real change." - Chris Dutton, Maven Analytics
